You can get the biggest Chanel bag in the store if you want it
I gave 'em the drip, they sucked it up, I got 'em on it
I bought a new Patek, I had the watch, so I two-toned 'em
Taking these drugs, I'm gon' be up until the morning
That ain't your car, you just a leaser, you don't own it
If I'm in the club, I got that fire when I'm performing
The backend just came in, in all hundreds
Vibes galore, cute shit, they all on us
I'm from Atlanta, where young niggas run shit
I know they hating on me, but I don't read comments
Whenever I tell her to come, she coming
Whenever it's smoke, we ain't running

Drip too hard, don't stand too close
You gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Doing all these shows, I've been on the road
I don't care where I go, long as I get paid

Diamonds dancing in the dial, like this shit is a parade
I don't want your chain, Young GunWun not a slave
I had to draw the line, too many bitches getting saved
TSA harass me, so I took a private plane
These pussy niggas lacking, why I'm working on my aim
Drip too hard (too hard), charge it to the card (to the card)
Designer to the ground, I can barely spell the names (uh)

Call me what you wanna, I'll be what you wanna
I've been here a thousand times, eh-eh
Falling for another, I don't even bother
I could do it all my life

So tell me if you wanna 'cause I got this feeling
I wanna hear you say it, 'cause I can't believe it
With every touch of you, it's like I've started dreaming
Guess Heaven's not that far away

And I'll be singing, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
You're breaking me, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

I'm just right here dancing around to the rhythm
The rhythm that you play when you're breaking my heart
You know that I can't get you out of my system
Yeah, right from the start, you played with my heart

And I'll be singing, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

You can do whatever, I'll be here forever
Spinning 'round inside this room, eh-eh
Won't you come on over? I'm a sucker for ya
Wishing we'll be out here soon

So tell me if you wanna 'cause I got this feeling
I wanna hear you say it, 'cause I can't believe it
With every touch of you, it's like I've started dreaming
Guess Heaven's not that far away

And I'll be singing, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
